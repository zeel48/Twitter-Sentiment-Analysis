This project implements a sentiment analysis model for Twitter data using Naive Bayes classifiers to categorize tweets into different sentiment categories. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed by removing stopwords from the text. Two feature extraction methods are employed: CountVectorizer (both binary and non-binary) and TF-IDF vectorization, to convert the cleaned text into numerical format suitable for model training.
The project utilizes Bernoulli Naive Bayes for binary features and Multinomial Naive Bayes for non-binary features, allowing for a comparison of their performances. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with accuracy scores evaluated for both models. The results indicate that the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model, with binary CountVectorizer, achieves the highest accuracy (approximately 75.68%).
A pipeline is created using TF-IDF vectorization combined with Multinomial Naive Bayes, which also shows satisfactory performance. Additionally, the code includes functionality for real-time user input, allowing users to input tweets and receive predictions on their sentiment categories based on the trained model.
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Naive Bayes classifiers in text classification tasks and highlights the importance of preprocessing and feature extraction methods in improving model accuracy for sentiment analysis in social media contexts.
